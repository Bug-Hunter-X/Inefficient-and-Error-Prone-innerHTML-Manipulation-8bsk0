# Inefficient innerHTML Manipulation in HTML

This repository demonstrates an uncommon yet potentially problematic coding practice in HTML: inefficiently using `innerHTML` to append content.  The `bug.html` file shows the issue, while `bugSolution.html` presents a more efficient and robust solution.

## Problem:
Repeatedly using the `+=` operator with `innerHTML` can result in performance degradation, particularly when dealing with large amounts of content or frequent updates.  The browser must repeatedly parse and render the entire HTML string each time the assignment is performed. This is significantly slower than other methods.

## Solution:
The recommended approach involves using `insertAdjacentHTML` or DOM manipulation methods (like `createElement` and `appendChild`) for better performance and maintainability.

This example showcases a simple yet illustrative case of this issue.  In larger applications, the performance difference can be quite substantial.
